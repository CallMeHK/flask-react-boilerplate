## What is this?

This is a basic implementation of a crud application, with a react frontend, flask backend and mongoDB database.  I planned on using this in future projects, but I have been working with node and golang more recently.  

## Set up

-Clone project
 - make sure you have python+pipenv installed
 - `cd flask-react-boilerplate`
 - `pipenv install`
 - `npm install`
 - `flask run`
 - `npm run dev`
